        Initially, checks if the ratings list exists in the output folder and if this is the case it loads it.

        dataset and creates a list with the movies ids. Then, within a for loop iterates the ratings dataframe and for
        each user keeps track of the ratings he gave to every movie. If he didn't rate a movie, the algorithm put a
        zero to the corresponding position of the vector. After finishing this process for every user, it returns the
